# Preferential Colouring of Random Graphs

This repository contains the code and resources for my bachelor thesis on the preferential colouring of random graphs. 
The main programming languages used are C++, Python and Mathematica.

The aim of this work was to develop methods for edge coloring of Barab\'asi---Albert random graphs 
in such a way as to minimize the number of required colors while preserving the planarity of monochromatic subgraphs. 
An additional goal was to explore coloring with a given colors number that minimize the number of crossing edges in each subgraph. 
An option of coloring with a given number of colors while minimizing the number of crossings in each subgraph was also considered.

To achieve this, well-known algorithms for selecting the maximum planar subgraph were presented, 
and the planarity of Barabási–Albert graphs was examined by estimating the expected number of~Kuratowski graph subdivisions in the random graph. 
Based on this, existing solutions were modified by incorporating a specific metric, and new approaches were proposed. 
All methods were tested and compared in terms of the quality of generated solutions as well as execution time. 
Significant improvements in the quality of the solutions were achieved without causing substantial changes to the computational complexity of the algorithms. 

Additionally, one application of such coloring was described.
